About ATM Machine Project in C++
The ATM system is based on the idea of generating the user’s total sum amount. This mechanism allows the user to deposit money, withdraw, and pay bills. After each transaction, this system reveals the precise amount to withdraw.

The entire project was created in the C++ programming language, and several variables and strings were employed in its construction.

The users will find this project to be simple to use and comprehend. When you run the compiled code of the project in Visual Studio IDE or its exe file. “PLEASE ENTER THE PINCODE,” a text message will appear on the display’s screen.
Now enter the pin code for each of the four users listed above. The pin number for the account from which you want to withdraw, deposit, or print the balance receipt must be that of the person whose account you wish to withdraw, deposit, or print the balance receipt.

The pin code is correct, the terminal will display the message “ENTER PASSWORD.” Enter the password of the person who previously entered the card pin code.
If you enter the wrong password, you will receive an error notice and be asked to try again. If you input a wrong password three times, your card will be taken (System just displays a message on console that your card is captured).
